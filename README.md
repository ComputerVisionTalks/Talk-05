# Talk-05

This week at Computer Vision Talks, we hosted [Krishna Murthy](https://krrish94.github.io/) for his paper, [gradSLAM: Dense SLAM meets Automatic Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10672). He is a PhD student at Mila and the Robotics and Embodied AI Lab, advised by Liam Paull. His research strives to develop embodied agents that perceive, reason, and act intelligently. The central aim of his research is to leverage our deep understanding of the rules of the world (physics, classical robotics, vision, graphics) to support modern deep learning machinery.
